# positive_correlated_rules


This repository complements the paper titled [...](https://doi.org/), and accommodates Julia files for simulating a population game.

## Concept

...


## Requirements
- Julia 1.10


## How to use
Following the [guide on environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/), you can open Julia in a terminal, press `]` to access the package manager, type `activate .` and then `instantiate`. 
After installing all the required software you can press backspace to exit the package manager, now you should have all the required libraries to run the code. To run the code either use Jupyter notebook for the interactive plot or open Julia and then type `include("pc_learning_rules.jl")` to run the main simulation (that will generate all figures).


## pc_learning_rules.jl
Runs the individual code files to generate all figures


## Aux.jl
## Dynamicsjl
## Protocols.jl
Contain functions used by pc_learning_rules.jl
